Constructive criticism - 
do not go in heavy detail unless asked . As many of the interview questions were mostly behavioral
do not get nervous and if you mess up. Tell the interviewer go back and revise
Technical questions will be asked for the final interview like talk about your development in xdma for example. 
Any language can be used for the final interview
time your responses, it should not take 5 minutes of rambling for a question like tell me about yourself (it should be a structured 2 minute response)


The third stage of the interview is purely behavioral and nothing else. I was asked like what is a difficult problem, what would your past supervisor say about you,  what do you know about Mathworks 

I think I passed the third stage I will see next week
The fourth stage will be a 4 hour technical and I can use python
