One:

  
Received a HackerRank OA and a HireVue with basic LC-styled and BQs respectively. Got an email to schedule a meet with Manager. In that call, talked about my background and deep-dived into one of my experiences. Also discussed the role and interest areas. 


Got a mail from a recruiter about 10 days later for scheduling the final interviews. Recruiter asked a bit about visa-status, graduation dates and stuff like that. It was virtual on-site interviews. 4 hours of interviews back to back with 15 minute breaks. First was a 2 hour technical round with an engineer in the EDG. Asked deep technical questions about one of my resume experiences. Then was asked a low-level system design question about designing a movie-ticket booking system. Had to code the entire thing and use OOP concepts. Then moved to a coding question. It was a 2 pointer logic question. Then in the last 15 minutes he asked me another question which was a DP question but asked me to solve using any other simpler approach. Just giving the approach was enough for the last question. 1 hour Behavioural rounds with the manager and an HR each. Got asked all the basic BQs you'd expect. This part was very chill, they didn't expect any particular sort of answers, just seemed like an informal chat. About 3 days later, I got a call for background check. 3 days after that I received a verbal offer from the manager which was materialised into an official offer letter next day.

Two:

3 Parts. Online Assessment through Hacker Rank, easy. Hiring Manager interview behavioral. Four hour (virtual on site) technical, behavioral, and more. The four hour interview consist of three parts: Technical with current EDG member, not difficult. Behavioral with Hiring manager again (seemed repetitive?), behavioral with recruiter. All seemed pretty easy but very lengthy and taxing.

Just a lc medium around
Only one leetcode problem
Rest was just talking about ur oa
I forgot it was some dp problem
Yeah they love their dp

I believe I passed the EDG Manager Interview, but I was told that further discussion is needed with the team to confirm

I passed the EDG Manager Interview

Final Interview Dec. 12

Here’s the formatted version:

**Technical Interview**:

- 1h 45min
    - Half an hour to review resume
    - OOP (just a very simple OOD; just know how to write basic inheritance, no need to prepare too much)
    - One coding question (very simple; I finished it too quickly, so the interviewer gave me another one and said it was okay if I didn’t finish, but I finished it very quickly)

---

**Manager Interview**:

- 45min
    - Pure Behavioral Questions

---

was asked about my sliding window C solution then I was asked to solve a movie ticket booking system (OOP question) with different guests types, movies, time slots, time for the time slots and so on - failed horribly on both ends (couldnt figure out time complexity of the C code)




I knew what they would ask exactly, (review of the OA done before) and doing the movie ticket OOP code (and I still didn't prepare much for those and failed, despicable, insanity)

Was called the next week to be informed that they rejected my application (i'm assuming because I did horribly on the technical portion, and the 3rd round with the HR manager wasn't so great. But ultimately it is mainly due to the technical portion)
